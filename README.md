 <h2>What it is</h2>
<p>For the final project at Red Academy we built real world live website for community client. It was designed by the UX students at Red Academy. A mobile first responsive Wordpress CMS website was created by the web development group(McKenzie Eggers, Michael Lelli, Lily Yang, Alban Carmet). </p>

<p>Mountain Health Team is a website created for client Amanda Chey. Its purpose to premote her clinic and provide information on
naturopathy.</p>

<p>The website was created using a mobile first approach, meaning that the mobile version of the website is designed first, and then additional CSS is written to create a desktop version when the screen size increases.
<br>
The backend of the website was setup so that the client can access and make changes to the website without coding knowledge. </p>
